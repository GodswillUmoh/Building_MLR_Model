# Building_MLR_Model

## Building A model with more than one Independent Variable
> When you have more than one independent variable (IV), such as x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6 etc, and y (dependent variable). They are many and we may decide to drop some of the IV.
> Why do we need to drop some, why can't we use all the predictors at once.
> 
> __Here are some Reasons we should consider dropping some:__
> 1. Garbage in Garbage out. Do not just use any how variables in your model as it can affect its efficiency
> 2. Selecting the ones that contribute to prdicting is better than having a thousand of them that do not all predict something.
